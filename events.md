Events are an implementation of observer pattern such that whenever an event takes place, then the one or more listener associated with that event responds. It can be imagine like something making an announcement to your application, and then actions being taken due to that announcement. All the event classes in Bagisto are stored in the **Providers** folder and the listeners are stored in the **Listeners** folder.


### Manually Registering Events

For the sake of simplicity, in Bagisto, we register events manually in the boot method of your ***EventServiceProvider*** as below:

```php
/**
* Register any other events for your application.
*
* @return void
*/
public function boot()
{
    parent::boot();

    Event::listen('event.name', 'path-upto-listener@function');
}
```

#### Manually Registering Listeners

As we see above, in registering events we specify listener function to be executed when event is called so on every event a listener function is to be executed


### How we specify events?

In most of **CRUD** operation. We had fired an event before and after the execution of function. So, that if some one want to perform any operation after or before product create/update/delete can perform by simply calling a listener function in event registration
