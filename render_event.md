To render any template before or after any function we may use view_rener_event


### Steps to render View

1. Create the page you want to render on view

2. and just use the name of event with function view_render_event

3. This will automatically fire and the page will be included

As , it is fired before and after the event so, this event helps to inject anything before or after the content.
