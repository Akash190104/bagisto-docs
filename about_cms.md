## CMS ( Content Management System )

In efforts to make bagisto interactive and user-friendly, we have added a new feature of CMS (Content Management System) through which admin has the power to create static pages content. The Pages created through CMS are in a combination of channel and locale i.e., the content of the page will be displayed only for channel and locale selected while creating pages.

### Steps to create pages in CMS

- All necessary fields are provided to create a page, so admin can customize the page by own. As we can see in the screenshot below.

- Now, about the content writing, the admin has the flexibility to use CSS classes i.e., Helper Classes and column layout classes.
