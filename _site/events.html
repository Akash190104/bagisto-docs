<p>Events provide a simple observer implementation which allows a user to subscribe and listen to various events triggered in the web application. All the event classes in Bagisto are stored in the <strong>Providers</strong> folder and the listeners are stored in the <strong>Listeners</strong> folder.</p>

<h3 id="manually-registering-events">Manually Registering Events</h3>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, in Bagisto, we register events manually in the boot method of your <strong><em>EventServiceProvider</em></strong> as below:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="sd">/**
* Register any other events for your application.
*
* @return void
*/</span>
<span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">boot</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">parent</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">boot</span><span class="p">();</span>

    <span class="nx">Event</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'event.name'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'path-upto-listener@function'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="manually-registering-listeners">Manually Registering Listeners</h4>

<p>As we see above, in registering events we specify listener function to be executed when event is called so on every event a listener function is to be executed</p>

<h3 id="how-we-specify-events">How we specify events?</h3>

<p>In most of <strong>CRUD</strong> operation. We had fired an event before and after the execution of function. So, that if some one want to perform any operation after or before product create/update/delete can perform by simply calling a listener function in event registration</p>

<h2 id="events-fired-in-bagisto">Events Fired in Bagisto</h2>

<p>Events fired in bagisto but not listened such that if any user wants to perform any action on event fire, then they may create listener file and perform the respective operation.</p>
